# VBA-challenge

I would like to start by saying I struggled very badly with this assignment.
I know that I did not complete it in the slightest and I wanted to submit something in order to resubmit in the future. 

I tried to write pseudo code to walk me through the process but I could never understand the full concept of loops and
how to incorporate them with so many different variables in this case. 

My VBA script contains some of that pseudo code in bits and pieces. I just wanted to try to explain my process before submission.
